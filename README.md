## Project Overview

The User Registration Application is a simple web application that allows users to register by providing their personal details, such as name, email, phone number, and age. Built with React on the frontend and ASP.NET Core on the backend, this application provides a responsive user interface using Bootstrap. Users can register through a form and view a list of all registered users, making it an effective tool for managing user registrations.
